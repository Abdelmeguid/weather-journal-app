first, you have to open the project folder via vscode, not the node js program folder.
then make the package.json file using this command npm init -y.
then install the required packages like this:
npm install express body-parser cors.
finally, run the application using this command node server.js.
note: in youtube i saw the engineer use the below command to prevent down and up the server during the update
npm i nodemon --save-dev
